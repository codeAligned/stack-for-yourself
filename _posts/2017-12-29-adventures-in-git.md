What makes a good pull request?
- ask yourself: what will the reviewer need to know? Are they working closely with me or are they going to have to look at my PR after a day of working  on something totally different? Will they have time to figure out what the change is, or not?
- ‎clear title
- ‎description in good English expressing what the problem was and what your solution is
- ‎are you working with a ticket tracker? Link the relevant task to your PR
- ‎are there any particularly thorny places in your code? Leave a comment about that specifically
- ‎make sure the PR base is correct to the best of your knowledge
- ‎make sure the only committed changes are those that are explicitly relevant for this PR
