## Start here

Before you do anything else, connect with the [technical community]({% post_url 2016-05-01-coding-community %}), especially locally. Most jobs aren't posted, and developer jobs are no different. You need to know people who know about jobs in their network, and who would recommend you into those roles.

[Negotiating job offers](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer-ee17cccbdab6#.wh6xk26pl): a brilliant mindset and information.

Remember that half, if not more, of the skills you need are soft skills. Here's a [fantastic guide on how to prepare for the soft-skills part of a developer interview](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-soft-skills-a8a5fb02c466).

#### Putting yourself together
* Put together your [portfolio]({% post_url 2016-05-01-portfolio %}).
* Build your resume using [Creddle](https://resume.creddle.io/): give it your resume content, select a theme or two, and see an amazing-looking resume pop out.

## Searching for work after coding bootcamp
As an inexperienced developer, you'll be at a disadvantage...but you [can still land a job. It's just harder](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2016/09/12/software-development-job-without-experience/).

[This](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-resources-nyc-startup-jobs-will-blaze?trk=prof-post) is a great place to look for start-up jobs. Why start-ups? Because they're more willing to take risks, which means hiring untried developers...and because there's so much work to be done that you'll have no choice but to grab hold with both hands.

[This](https://clutchtalent.github.io/beginning-job-search/) is an amazing thoughtful guide to getting your first job after bootcamp or a self-taught program.
