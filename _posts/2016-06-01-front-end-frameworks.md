## Start here

There's quite a lot of JavaScript frameworks to choose from! Here's an [article to help you decide which one](https://www.sitepoint.com/top-javascript-frameworks-libraries-tools-use/) you're going to learn. [Here's another one discussing the top current frameworks and topics to learn](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-topics-to-learn-in-2017-700a397b711).

My 2 cents: Angular.js, developed by Google, and React, developed by Facebook, are [coming out on the very top](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51#.275mvwu8w). [Angular](#angularjs) looked like it was taking the lead for a while, but now [React](#react) is making a much stronger leap forward, and it looks like it's going to emerge as the winner in terms of popularity, ease of use, and demand.

Learning JavaScript in today's world can be [pretty messy](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.yufaj0qrc), and even experienced developers can find themselves at a loss in this new JavaScript ecosystem.

## Start here
Check out this great roadmap: ["From Zero to Front-end Hero, Part 2"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-2-adfa4824da9b#.jipjenhuj) ([Part 1](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-1-7d4f7f0bff02#.sb4dij3lx) is for HTML & CSS).

Learn and use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host your pages and sites: essentially a free, hosted, live version of your front-end repositories.

## Jekyll
Jekyll is an amazing, lightweight front-end framework for organizing and generating files and partials.
It's got [great documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and was created by a Github founder. It's an awesome solution for rolling your own blog or small personal site, and can be hosted for free on Github's [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I built a [seed Jekyll application](https://github.com/mindplace/jekyll-seed) with tons of lovely features for you to fork and use for free on Github for your own projects.

* [Prose.io](http://prose.io/): create MD files via a web interface that immediately show up on the appropriate Jekyll site (or just to the appropriate repository).
* [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/): even better than Prose.io, it's a lightweight [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) that mimics Wordpress' functionality for Jekyll sites.
* [Hydejack](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack), one of my favorite Jekyll themes.
* [Lots of Jekyll themes](https://github.com/drjekyllthemes/themes)
* [Planet Jekyll](http://planetjekyll.github.io/showcase/), an awesome showcase of many Jekyll themes
* [Gorgeous HMFAYSAL Omega theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/hmfaysal/hmfaysal-omega-theme)
* [Liquid documentation](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid): the Ruby-based language Jekyll uses to manage dynamic qualities in building your site.
* [Tags and categories with Jekyll](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/)
* [Jekyll tags from scratch](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/)
* [Put interactive Ruby snippets on your blog](http://blog.klipse.tech/ruby/2016/06/20/blog-ruby.html)
* [Using static site generators at scale](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/using-a-static-site-generator-at-scale-lessons-learned/): specifically, Jekyll. Great read.
* [Putting Disqus comments onto a Jekyll site](http://estherleytush.com/2016/06/25/adding-comments-to-jekyll-site.html): basically the comments feature below! (And this is a Jekyll site.)
* [Implement Jekyll search using lunr.js](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/): adding search functionality to a Jekyll site
* [Create and publish your own Jekyll theme gem](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-and-publish-a-jekyll-theme-gem--cms-27475)
* [Documentation for jekyll-assets](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/jekyll-assets/0.13.0), a very useful gem for managing assets with Jekyll in a Rails-like way
