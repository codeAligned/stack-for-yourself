## Start here

**Prerequisite: [understand how the Internet works, how apps make and respond to requests, and other essential networks]({% post_url 2016-10-01-networking-basics %}).**

[APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), or *application programming interfaces*, are kind of hard to define. In the context of web development, APIs denote websites that accept requests through [HTTP](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp) (the same process as when you type a URL into your browser and hit 'Enter', only through code), and respond back with [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/json/) containing your requested information. Open APIs in this case means essentially databases that you can access via a programming interface.

To understand the concept behind using APIs to get information from a server, read Thoughtworks' great post on [REST API design and resource modeling](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rest-api-design-resource-modeling).


[Here's a small tutorial I wrote]({% post_url 2016-08-22-accessing-apis-with-ruby %}) on how to use Ruby to access an API.

Check out [Rise of APIs](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/21/the-rise-of-apis/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29), a cool article talking about the current status of APIs.

### Code you'll need to make API calls

#### Ruby
* [Net::HTTP Cheatsheet](http://www.rubyinside.com/nethttp-cheat-sheet-2940.html), best short-and-sweet support for making raw HTTP requests with Ruby, no framework required.
* [HTTP Calls with Ruby](https://blog.codeship.com/http-calls-ruby/)
* [unirest](http://unirest.io/ruby), helping you make very clean http requests without the headache of [Net::HTTP](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html) syntax.


#### JavaScript
* ["A practical guide to fetch(), reduce() and formatting data from an external API"](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-practical-guide-to-fetch-reduce-and-formatting-data-from-an-external-api-283ddd9bfdcb)
* Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), a great, free tool that helps you with all aspects of using or developing APIs with JavaScript.
* You'll need to understand CORS (cross-origin resource sharing). We have resources on that on our [networking basics]({% post_url 2016-10-01-networking-basics%}) page.

* The [Imgur API](https://api.imgur.com/endpoints), making API calls to Imgur.
