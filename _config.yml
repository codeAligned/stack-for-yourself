    Hi, I'm Esther, [@mindpl_ace on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mindpl_ace) and [@mindplace on Github](https://github.com/mindplace/). I love coding, get excited about web development, and
    love sharing what I know with others.

    I'm [elsewhere on the internet](http://estherleytush.com/), and I would love to
    [hear from you](http://estherleytush.com/contact/) about your full-stack journey.
